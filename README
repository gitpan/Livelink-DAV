Livelink-DAV version 0.0012
=========================

Livelink::DAV - Perl extension for Perl extension for providing a Opentext Livelink EWS WebDAV connecter instance for CopyTree::VendorProof.

This module provides CopyTree::VendorProof a connector instance with methods to deal with remote Livelink EWS WebDAV file operations.

What?

Oh, yes.  You've probabaly stumbled across this module because you wanted to copy something recursively.  Did you want to move some files into or off your SharePoint file server?  Did you buy Opentext's Livelink EWS and wish to automate some file transfers?  Well, this is kinda the right place, but it gets righter. Check out the documentation on my CopyTree::VendorProof module, where I have a priceless drill and screw analogy for how these modules all work together.  The information on this page is a tad too technical if all you're trying to decide is whether this is the module you need.
